By default, Maven looks for the parent POM first at project’s root, then the local repository, and lastly in the remote repository.
If parent POM file is not located in any other place, then you can use code tag. This relative path shall be relative to project root.
If the parent POM is not located in the parent folder, we need to use the relativePath tag to refer to the location.
For example, the diagram shown in below
● aggregator (MAIN_FOLDER - pom.xml)
  |
  |
  |
  |-----> Module 1 (pom.xml)
  |
  |
  |
  |-----> Module 2 (pom.xml)
